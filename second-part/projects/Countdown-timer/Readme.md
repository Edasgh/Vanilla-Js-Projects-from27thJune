# Countdown Timer

## My Learnings From this PRoect :
 1. If we find a date's time then the time will be in miliseconds always
 2. That's why we converted one day, hour, minute and second to miliseconds to find how many days,hours,minutes and seconds are remaining
 3. At first we divide the remaining time (in miliseconds) by one day to find out how many days are left.
 Meanwhile we got remaining hours as remainder. So, we divide that remainer by an hour then, we get how many minutes are left as remainder and so on (till seconds). And that's how we get remaining days, hours, minutes and seconds
