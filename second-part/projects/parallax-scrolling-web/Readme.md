# This is my first parallax website project (not-responsive yet )

## My Learnings From this Project :

 1. The only way to create parallax effect only with css is to put the pictures to have a parallax effect in background of any div not as image tags

 2. If we put the images as background images of any div, then we have to make sure that we have to give "background-attachment:fixed" css property to each of those divs

 3. body and html height should be 100% to make that effect work properly
